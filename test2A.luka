// This test covers several main components of the Luka coding language:
// Lines starting with "//" should be comments

  // whitespace and empty lines should be ignored
  
// printing an integer should do exactly that
print(5) // and comments at the end of a line don't matter
// lines can either end in a semicolon or not (without will give a warning)
print(6);
// there can be semicolons (with or without spaces) in the middle to put multiple commands on one line
print(7);print(8); print(9)
// again, these still are able to end in a semicolon or not
print(10); print(11);
// they should perform operations in the expected order
print(6+7)
// throwing errors for wrong ordered items
// print(6) + print(7); // should be an error
// and make sure the print function isn't empty (to do an empty line, just print(0))
// print() // should be a syntax error, wrong insides
// and addition should be okay with spaces
print(1 + 1);
print(2+ 2);
print(3 +3);
print(4+4);
// testing subtraction
print(2 - 1);
print(1- 2);
print(3- 1);
print(4-2);
// make sure it goes in the expected order
print(4 - 2 - 1);
print(4 - 2 + 1);
